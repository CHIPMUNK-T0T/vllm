FileSystemTierManager: Pure-Python file system secondary tier for KV cache offloading.

Store path:
    Data is written to a temp file (<dest_path.tmp>) via os.write,
    then os.replace'd to the final path (without .tmp).

Load path:
    Data is read from the block file directly via os.readv into the
    provided memoryview slice.

File naming:  <base_path>_r<rank>/<hhh>/<hh>_g<group_idx>/<hash_hex>.bin
              (hash-based subdirectories to limit directory fan-out)

Manifest:
    <base_path>/config.json records the namespace identity together with
    the compatibility fields the namespace hash omits, and is checked on
    first use. A namespace written by a run this one cannot read disables
    the tier rather than being reinterpreted.

    submit_store / submit_load are non-blocking: they enqueue tasks and return.
    get_finished_jobs() polls job completion and returns completed JobResults.

    Cross-process sharing:
        KV cache sharing between multiple vLLM instances using the same
        ``root_dir`` (e.g., via a shared PVC) works by default: ``NONE_HASH``
        (the chain-hash seed for block content hashes) is derived from a fixed
        default seed, so identical token content produces identical block
        filenames across instances. Setting the ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` environment
        variable to the same value on all instances overrides the default seed,
        and is required to share a cache when using a non-cryptographic
        prefix-caching hash algorithm, which seeds ``NONE_HASH`` randomly.
        The manifest records which seed a namespace was written under, so an
        instance whose seed disagrees is told rather than left to miss on
        every block; a randomly seeded one is warned that it can never reuse
        the namespace at all.
